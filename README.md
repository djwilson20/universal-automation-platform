AI-powered data classification and presentation automation
# Universal AI Automation Platform

A comprehensive data classification and presentation automation system designed to transform manual business workflows into intelligent, automated processes with enterprise-grade security controls.

## Problem Statement

Organizations spend significant manual effort on data processing and presentation creation, while facing increasing requirements for data security classification and compliance. Current solutions either lack intelligence (simple templates) or ignore security requirements (basic automation tools).

## Solution Overview

The Universal AI Automation Platform provides end-to-end automation for two critical business workflows:

1. **Data â†’ PowerPoint**: Transform raw business data into executive-ready presentations with automated security classification
2. **Data â†’ Process Automation**: Intelligent workflow optimization with risk assessment and compliance monitoring

### Key Features

- **AI-Powered Data Classification**: Semantic analysis with 85%+ accuracy for PII, financial data, and business information
- **Security-First Architecture**: OWASP Top 10 compliance with automated risk assessment and protection recommendations
- **Enterprise Integration**: SAP-compliant presentation generation with corporate branding standards
- **Measurable ROI**: Documented 75% reduction in manual presentation creation time

report = classifier.generate_executive_summary(results)
print(report)
```

### Complete Automation Pipeline
```bash
# Command Line Interface
# 1. Classify data and assess security risks
python src/enhanced_classifier.py

# 2. Generate business content and insights
