## Security Architecture

### Security Model: Access-Based Control

**Principle:** Restrict system access rather than implement complex data anonymization.

**Implementation:**
- User whitelist maintained within application code
- Authentication check on system startup
- Authorized users are responsible for data they process
- No network-based authentication dependencies

**Rationale:**
- Leverages existing corporate data access permissions
- Simpler to implement and maintain than privacy-preserving architectures
- Aligns with existing corporate security models (SharePoint, Teams)
- Reduces regulatory complexity in GDPR environment

### Data Security Classifications

| Level | Description | Handling Requirements |
|-------|-------------|----------------------|
| TOP_SECRET | SSN, Credit Cards, Banking Details | Immediate tokenization required |
| RESTRICTED | Account Numbers, Personal Addresses | Encryption and controlled access |
| CONFIDENTIAL | Names, Emails, Phone Numbers | Selective masking, access controls |
| INTERNAL | Employee IDs, Customer IDs, Business Metrics | Internal personnel access only |
| PUBLIC | Zip Codes, Product Categories | Standard handling |
